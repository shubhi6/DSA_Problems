// Cycle sort is an in-place sorting Algorithm, unstable sorting algorithm, 
// and a comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to the original array. 
 

// It is optimal in terms of the number of memory writes. It minimizes the number of memory writes to sort 
// (Each value is either written zero times if itâ€™s already in its correct position or written one time to its correct position.)
// It is based on the idea that the array to be sorted can be divided into cycles. Cycles can be visualized as a graph.
//  We have n nodes and an edge directed from node i to node j if the element at i-th index must be present at j-th index in the sorted array. 
//  EXAMPLE :
//  Cycle in arr[] = {2, 4, 5, 1, 3} 
//  Cycle in arr[] = {4, 3, 2, 1}
