//Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:
 

//1. Any node can be a starting point.
//We can traverse the whole list by starting from any point.
//We just need to stop when the first visited node is visited again. 

//2. Useful for implementation of a queue.
//Unlike this implementation, we donâ€™t need to maintain two pointers for front and rear if we use a circular linked list.
//We can maintain a pointer to the last inserted node and the front can always be obtained as the next of last.

//3. Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list.
//For example, when multiple applications are running on a PC,
//it is common for the operating system to put the running applications on a list and then to cycle through them,
//giving each of them a slice of time to execute,
//and then making them wait while the CPU is given to another application.
//It is convenient for the operating system to use a circular list so that,
//when it reaches the end of the list it can cycle around to the front of the list.

//4. Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.
